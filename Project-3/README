Project 3 is an addition of important features towards the completion of the game such as constructing a player object and HUD, inclusion of Artificial Intelligence, and collision detection.

1. A player object is constructed (here, dumbo the elephant). Keys asdw are to be used to control the player.

2. Collision detection and AI. Some of the sprites in the game are smart and react to the player when the player gets close. The observer design pattern is used to enable the player to notify NPCs of its position.

3. A HUD is designed which controls information about gameplay. The player can toggle the HUD with F1 key.
