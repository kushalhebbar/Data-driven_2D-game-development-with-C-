Project description: Generating a drawing using SDL 2.0 drawing primitives to draw a figure. These draw function primitives include:
SDL RenderDrawLine, SDL RenderDrawPoint, and SDL RenderDrawRect. 

This project consists of 2 classes: 
- draw 
- FrameGenerator

The FrameGenerator class will write your figure to a file in a directory called frames. You must create the frames directory
as a subdirectory of your project directory and you should supply your username in the main program.
