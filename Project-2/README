Project description: Generating a drawing using SDL 2.0

The easiest part of this project: 
 - Figuring out what to draw using SDL and imagining what geometric shapes are needed to get the required result.

Problems that I had in completing this project:
 - Becoming comfortable with the coordinate system.
 - Drawing rectangles in any other angle apart from those perpendicular to the x and y axis.
 - Figuring out that the unnecessary usage of SDL_RenderPresent slows the rendering process of the objects.
