Project 2 consists of building over project 1 and further improvements in terms of improving code structure, using inheritence and polymorphism along with other minor changes listed below:

1. Conversion of while loops into ranged for loops, for example:
• ParseXML::display(),
• Gamedata::displayData()

2. Conversion of the first 3 ranged for loops in the ImageFactory destructor to while loops without using auto.

3. Conversion of ImageFactory from a GoF singleton into a Meyers singleton.

4. Using IoMod and C ++ stringstreams to write the fps of my game on the screen

5. Added generality to IoMod by permitting the user to write text in a different color font. This is done by overloading IoMod::writeText to accept an additional parameter, the new font color, and use this font to write the text.

6. Incorporate parallax scrolling into the animation by using at least two backgrounds. 

7. Using delete to “explicitly disallow compiler generated functions” in Engine, and ImageFactory.
