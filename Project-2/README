Project description: Polymorphism in action

What sprite did I repeat at least 7 times?
- I repeated the Bird sprite 7 times.

What sprite (not Sprite or MultiSprite) did I design?
- twowaysprite.cpp and twowaysprite.h

The easiest part of this project: Task 1,2,4,5,7,10,11 were easy. Task 3 was easy after watching the video. 

Problems that I had in completing this project: 
- Finding the right backgrounds for the parallax scrolling.
- Learning Photoshop in order to blend two different backgrounds into one to make an attractive background.
- Finding relevant Sprites that have a frame by frame sprite sheet, removing the background and making them transparent.
