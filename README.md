This repository consists of a 2-Dimensional game constructed purely using C++ and SDL 2.0, consists of various design patterns and in depth concepts of C++. The entire game is Data driven and robust. The game has been tested on Windows and Linux platforms. 

Various packages related to SDL has to be installed. I personally would suggest making use of Synaptics package manager on Linux OS to install the packages.
Each phase of the project has been checked for memory leaks and has no memory leaks apart from those that SDL inherently introduces.

Each project is a different phase of the final game. Please find a different README attached with each phase describing the new features added as well as a link to Google drive consisting of the result of that phase.

Please feel free to reproduce the game or make use of my game framework to build your own game.

Let's get creative and create more wonderful games for everybody to enjoy! Have fun!
