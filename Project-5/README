Project 5 is a complete playable game.

My game reaches a conclusion after 2 levels. I have included the intro sound clip of the movie "Dumbo" to make the gaming experience more involving.

The final game also includes a restart option after the conclusion (successful or otherwise) along with the inclusion of a god mode where the player doesn't die which is triggered with key 'G'.

Checked for memory leaks using Valgrind (Results in a leak free framework) and tested on Windows as well as Linux operating system

(Key assignments: F1 ⇒ help (HUD), F4 ⇒ frames, g ⇒ “god” mode, and r ⇒ restart)

Final game description:
Dumbo, the flying elephant is on a mission to collect his beloved fruits. Two things stand in his way, the mean flying Mr. Stork and the hungry vicious piranhas swimming in the ocean. With rotten tomatoes being his only weapon to fight against these evils, he sets on his mission. Dumbo can be controlled using the WASD keys, the spacebar can be used to shoot tomatoes. Level 1 would be to successfully collect all the fruits. Upon completion of level 1 there will be a level 2 which is the 'gem rush' where the mission is to collect all the gems which leads to the completion of the game. R key can be used to restart the game at any point in time, G key can be used to activate God mode where Dumbo gains supernatural abilities to fight the enemies and destroy them upon collision. With the sun setting in the background, the 2 lights play a subtle role in depecting twilight, bringing together the darkness from the right and light from the left.
The boat guy in the game is just enjoying a pleasant evening.
