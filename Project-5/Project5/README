Project description: Object Pooling, Explosions, and Projectiles

The easiest part of this project:
- Chunking was fairly simple as it was clearly explained in class
- Creating the HUD for the object pooling

Problems that I had in completing this project:
- Creating a game which has 2 levels (collection of fruits and then the gems) was not simple
- Chunking when the player is not moving happens to not be in random direction, however works perfectly when 2 moving sprites collide with each other
- Finding appropriate sprites to fit the theme of the game
- Projectiles and object pooling was considerably time consuming but the videos made it easier
- Recording a video was a struggle as there were a lot of components that I wanted to showcase and doing that within 20 seconds was a true struggle and a test of patience.

Final Project:
-> First level: Dumbo needs to collect all the fruits on the screen without coming in contact with the piranhas or Mr.Stork.
He can fire rotten tomatos at Mr.Stork temporarily disabling him from the screen allowing enought time to evade.
-> Second level: Dumbo will then get a gem rush which generates gems to be collected. Game ends upon collection of these gems.

Future improvements:
- Either give Dumbo 3 lives or add a HP bar
- Reduce size of Mr.Stork for level 1 and increase the size for level 2 to increase difficulty
- Menu
- Lights shining on the sun
- Restart option
- Better representation of Gameover
- Sound
- God mode
